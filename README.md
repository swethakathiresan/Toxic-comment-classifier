# Toxic Comment Classification

## Problem Definition

The project aims to address the challenge of identifying toxic comments within online communities more effectively. It involves developing and optimizing a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting toxic language in user-generated content. The primary objective is to create a robust system that can automatically flag and moderate toxic comments, thereby fostering healthier online interactions and reducing the negative impact of toxic behavior on community members.

## Dataset Selection

The dataset chosen for this project is sourced from Wikipedia's online discussion pages, providing a diverse range of user-generated comments spanning various topics and interactions. This dataset offers a rich and realistic representation of online discourse, allowing for the development and evaluation of machine learning models in a context closely resembling real-world scenarios. With its wide array of comments covering different subjects and tones, the dataset presents a comprehensive tested for training and validating the toxicity detection model. Additionally, the availability of labelled data facilitates supervised learning approaches, enabling the construction of accurate predictive models.

## Pre-processing Techniques

1. **Handling Missing Data**: The dataset is checked for missing values using the `check_null` function, which calculates and prints the percentage of missing values in each column. This ensures that any missing data is appropriately addressed before proceeding with the analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various exploratory analyses are conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. This includes examining the distribution of target labels, visualizing label counts using bar plots, and generating heatmaps to visualize correlations between different comment types.

3. **Text Cleaning**: Regular expressions are employed to remove IP addresses from comments using the `strip_ip` function. This step ensures that sensitive information is masked, thus preserving user privacy while maintaining the integrity of the dataset.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are engineered from the text data to capture relevant information for toxicity detection. These features include:
   - Comment length in characters (`length`)
   - Percentage of capitalized characters (`caps`)
   - Average word length (`word_length`)
   - Number of exclamation marks (`exclamation`)
   - Number of question marks (`question`)

5. **Tokenization**: Tokenization is performed using the Keras `Tokenizer` class, which converts text data into sequences of integers. This step prepares the text data for further processing and analysis, particularly for modeling tasks involving recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

6. **Word Count Visualization**: Word counts are visualized using bar plots and word clouds to understand the vocabulary distribution within different subsets of comments (e.g., clean comments, toxic comments). This helps identify common words and patterns associated with toxic behavior.

## Ideology

The ideology behind these preprocessing techniques is to prepare the raw text data for effective analysis and modeling to address the problem of toxicity detection in online comments. The overarching goal is to create a robust and reliable system that can accurately classify comments as toxic or non-toxic, thereby fostering a healthier online community environment. By performing thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and text preprocessing, the analysis aims to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the text data, enabling the development of advanced machine learning models for toxicity detection.

## Novelty

1. **Integrated Approach**: The preprocessing techniques described above represent an integrated approach that combines traditional data cleaning methods with advanced feature engineering and text processing techniques. By incorporating multiple steps such as missing data handling, text cleaning, feature extraction, and tokenization, the analysis ensures comprehensive preprocessing of the text data, setting a strong foundation for subsequent modeling efforts.

2. **Custom Feature Engineering**: The inclusion of custom-engineered features such as comment length, percentage of capitalized characters, average word length, and counts of punctuation marks adds novelty to the preprocessing pipeline. These features provide additional insights into the linguistic characteristics of toxic comments, enriching the dataset and potentially improving model performance.

3. **Visualization and Interpretation**: The use of visualization techniques such as bar plots and word clouds to analyze word counts and vocabulary distribution adds a novel dimension to the preprocessing process. By visually inspecting the most common words and patterns in clean and toxic comments, the analysis gains valuable insights into the language used in different contexts, which can inform subsequent modeling decisions and strategies.

4. **Application to Online Communities**: The focus on toxicity detection in online comments represents a novel application of machine learning techniques to address real-world challenges in online community management. By targeting toxic behavior in online interactions, the analysis aims to contribute to the creation of safer and more inclusive online environments, ultimately benefiting users and communities across various online platforms.
